✈️ Java Flight Booking App  
A small desktop app made with Java and JavaFX for managing flights and tickets at an airport

This project is from way back in 2022 — one of the first things I built!  
You'll probably spot some rookie mistakes (I do too), but I wanted to share it as part of my learning journey :)  
The UI is definitely a bit rough around the edges — I was rushing to get it working. Still, it’s a fun glimpse into my early coding experiments!

💡 My goals in this project were:  
Practicing Git for solo development  
Using VMC design pattern  
Building something visual using JavaFX  
Applying Object-Oriented Programming principles
